# Data Directory

This directory stores the CLI's runtime data.

## Files

### projects.json

Tracks all projects that have Claude commands installed.

**Format:**
```json
{
  "project-name": "/absolute/path/to/project",
  "another-project": "/absolute/path/to/another"
}
```

**Schema:** See `projects-schema.json`

**Key points:**
- Project names are the directory names (not full paths)
- Paths must be absolute
- Name collisions are detected and rejected
- This file is auto-generated by the CLI

## Maintenance

- **Do not edit projects.json manually** - use the CLI commands
- This directory is gitignored to keep local data out of version control
- The CLI will recreate an empty projects.json if it's missing or corrupted
